# HTTP methods

- GET : request for information
- POST : provides data
- DELETE : removes data
- PATCH : updates/changes data
- PUT : provide/replaces data (idempotent)
- HEAD : gets metadata

POST : here is some data
PUT : here is some data to fill this gap

Idempotency: having the same result each time.

## Requests

- The server has the power
- All HTTP requests are requests only
- Even fulfilled requests might not be fulfilled the way you think
