"""
We're going to build a program that takes an input 
of three sides of a shape and tells you if it would 
make a valid triangle.

In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be 
larger than the remaining side. 

For example, the triangle 5 10 25 is impossible, 
because 5 + 10 is not larger than 25.

We'll also keep a track of how many valid triangles 
we've been able to make
