## Notebooks

- Scripts are good for tasks; notebooks are good for exploration
- Notebooks keep documentation and code next to each other
- Notebooks divide everything into cells (markdown/python/other stuff)
- Notebooks need to connect to a `.venv` with `ipykernel` in
- Code cells share memory but execute independently
